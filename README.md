# Toward Practical Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation via Point-Level Supervision

This is the implementation of the method described in paper: toward practical weakly supervised semantic segmentation via point-level supervision.

### Requirements
- Python3.7+
- Pytorch1.0+
- Numpy, OpenCV
- Pydensecrf

### Usage
The results can be reproduced by simply runing scripts train_xxx.py, e.g.,
```bash
python train_voc_all.py --gpus 0,1,2,3
```

### TODO
- [ ] clean code.
